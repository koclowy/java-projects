#  OneMinute – Survival Strategy Game (Advanced Programming Project)

**OneMinute** is a JavaFX survival strategy game where players try to endure a pandemic lockdown for 30 days.  
Every decision impacts the family’s **hunger**, **thirst**, **morale**, and **health**.  
Players shop for supplies, manage daily events, make journal choices, survive random challenges, and aim to reach Day 30.

A key highlight of this project:  
### 🎨 **All artworks (characters, backgrounds, UI, icons) were hand-drawn by me using Procreate and Pixel Studio.**

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Create an interactive survival game using JavaFX and OOP concepts  
- Implement multi-screen navigation (Login → Storyline → Shopping → Cashier → Day Counter → Home → Journal → Win/Defeat)  
- Integrate game logic such as resource management, daily events, status updates  
- Provide an immersive user experience using pixel-art visuals and background music  
- Build a login system with register, reset password, and validation  
- Use JavaFX components such as AnchorPane, ImageView, Buttons, Labels, TilePane, etc.  
- Manage game progression with event handling, timers, animations, and save features

## 🖥 Gameplay Overview  

### 🧾 Login & User System
- Login, Register, Reset Password  
- Password validation & error alerts  
- Data stored in encrypted local files  

### 📖 Storyline Screens
- Intro story fades in gradually  
- Animated transition buttons  
- Setup for the 30-day survival challenge  

### 🛒 60-Second Shopping Phase
- Player selects items from shelves  
- Items include water, canned food, medicine, bug spray, etc.  
- Time pressure: 60-second timer  
- Tooltip descriptions for each item  

### 💵 Cashier Review
- Player reviews selected items before starting lockdown  

### 📅 Day Counter (Day 1–30)
- “Next Day” logic with updated hunger/thirst/morale  
- Scenes transition using JavaFX animations  

### 🏠 Home Screen
- Access Journal Story and Journal Status  
- Pause game (Continue / Save / Quit)  

### 📘 Journal Decisions (Daily Events)
Based on pages 17–22 (Yes/No choices).  
Each day includes:

- Story event  
- 2 decision choices (Yes / No)  
- Status changes to health, hunger, thirst, morale  
- Effects displayed in the journal text area  
- Move to next day  

### 🏆 Win / ❌ Defeat Conditions
- **Win:** Survive all 30 days :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Lose:** Health/morale/hunger/thirst reaches 0, or 2 family members die

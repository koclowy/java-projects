# 🌍 ClimateEducationApp – Java OOP Project

**ClimateEducationApp** is an educational Java application designed to raise awareness about SDG 13, targeting global warming, greenhouse gases, pollution causes, and climate-related facts.  
It provides an interactive experience through simple GUI pages that help users understand climate issues in an accessible way.

This project was built for my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** module using the principles of modularity, encapsulation, and event-driven programming.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To educate users about **global warming** and its environmental impact  
- To explain **greenhouse gases** and how they contribute to climate change  
- To introduce the causes and effects of **pollution**  
- To provide simple, interactive pages that improve user engagement  
- To apply **OOP concepts** such as classes, methods, UI components, and event handling

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

### **Language**
- Java (JDK)

### **Tools**
- Apache NetBeans IDE  
- Draw.io (for flowcharts & visual diagrams)  
- ChatGPT (assistance with documentation & debugging)

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- The fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java
- Structuring Java programs using packages, classes, and methods
- Creating simple GUI applications using Java Swing
- Handling button events and user interactions
- Improving code readability through comments and modular design
- Basic debugging techniques in Apache NetBeans

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Updating the application UI for a more modern feel
- Adding animations or transitions for interactive learning
- Including quizzes or simple activities for users
- Expanding content with more climate topics
- Adding audio or images for better engagement
- Improving navigation flow between pages

<h1 align="center">⊹₊⟡⋆ Java Projects ⊹₊⟡⋆</h1>

A curated collection of my Java applications built throughout my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Advanced Programming** courses.  
These projects explore Java fundamentals, GUI interfaces, JavaFX, event-driven logic, storytelling, and custom artwork integration.

All projects were created using **Java**, with development supported by **Apache NetBeans**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Figma**, **Procreate**, **Pixel Studio**, **Scene Builder**, and **Draw.io**. AI tools such as ChatGPT were used for ideation, debugging, and documentation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **ClimateEducationApp (OOP Project)**
- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** Apache NetBeans, Draw.io  
- **Description:**  
  An educational Java application designed to teach users about global warming, greenhouse gases, pollution, and environmental awareness.  
  Includes simple UI pages, navigation buttons, climate facts, and interactive elements.  
- **Folder:** [climate education app](/OOP/ClimateEducationApp/)

### 2. **OneMinute – Survival Strategy Game (Advanced Programming)**  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** JavaFX + FXML  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Apache NetBeans, Scene Builder, Figma, Procreate, Pixel Studio, Draw.io  
- **Description:**  
  A survival strategy game inspired by navigating a 30-day pandemic lockdown.  
  Players manage hunger, thirst, morale, and health while facing daily events and making choices that affect outcomes.  
  Includes login/register, storyline screens, shopping phase with a 60-second timer, journal decisions, day counter, win/defeat screens, and pixel-art visuals.  
  **All UI artwork (characters, backgrounds, icons) was hand-drawn by me.**

## About This Repository
This repository showcases my growth in Java — progressing from foundational OOP concepts to full-scale GUI applications involving:

- Object-oriented design  
- JavaFX UI development  
- Event handling  
- Game logic and state management  
- File handling  
- Custom artwork integration  
- Multi-screen navigation in JavaFX  

More Java applications will be added as I continue to build my portfolio.

# ☕ Java Projects

A curated collection of my Java applications built throughout my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Advanced Programming** courses.  
These projects explore Java fundamentals, GUI interfaces, JavaFX, event-driven logic, storytelling, and custom artwork integration.

All projects were created using **Java**, with development supported by **Apache NetBeans**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Figma**, **Procreate**, **Pixel Studio**, **Scene Builder**, and **Draw.io**. AI tools such as ChatGPT were used for ideation, debugging, and documentation.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository showcases my growth in Java — progressing from foundational OOP concepts to full-scale GUI applications involving:

- Object-oriented design  
- JavaFX UI development  
- Event handling  
- Game logic and state management  
- File handling  
- Custom artwork integration  
- Multi-screen navigation in JavaFX  

More Java applications will be added as I continue to build my portfolio.
